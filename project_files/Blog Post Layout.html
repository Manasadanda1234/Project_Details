            <p>I would like to thank to Project Manager KASHIF for giving
            me this invaluable opportunity to learn practical knowledge which would have impossible
            to learn through looking at images from textbooks.</p>

            <h2>Description of the Project:</h2>
            <p>Building construction is the engineering deals with the construction of building such as
            residential houses. Nowadays the house building is major work of the social progress of
            the country. Daily new techniques are being developed for the construction of houses
            economically, quickly and fulfilling the requirements of the community engineers and
            architects do the design work, planning and layout, etc., of the buildings .Draughtsman
            are responsible for doing the drawing works of building as for the direction of engineers
            and architects. </p>

            <h2>Curing and Strengthening:</h2>
            <p>Once you've mastered the basics, it's time to explore advanced topics like responsive design, server-side programming, and modern frameworks like React or Vue.js.</p>

            <p>In order to protect the concrete surface from drying out too soon, proper curing calls for
            maintaining moisture on it. This is particularly crucial when it's hot and dry outside. A
            minimum of seven to ten days must pass for curing in order for the strength to be achieved.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
            <p>The method is highly effective and guarantees optimal outcomes, resulting in a construction
            that combines strength and durability to perfection. By breaking up the labour into many
            tasks and maximizing worker efficiency, this approach lowers the amount of work that each
            employee must complete in a given day.</p>
